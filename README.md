# cipher generator
a collection of encryption methods to generate various ciphers based on your input string

## atbash 
an atbash cipher is a mono-alphabetic cipher that replaces each letter with its alphabetic reflection (i.e. a <--> z, b <--> y, c <--> x, etc.)

## bacon
a bacon cipher hides your message within plaintext by using two different typefaces. every 5 letters in the resulting plaintext will represent one letter of the coded message based on the order of the typefaces. for example, the letter 'h' has the code 'aabbb' and the letter 'i' has the code 'abaaa' so the message: 'i lIKE bAcon' is code for 'hi'
